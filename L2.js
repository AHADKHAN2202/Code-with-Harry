// variables in javascript and data types

// let a = 17;
// console.log(a);
// let , var and const  are used to declare variable 
// a is a identifier or variable name
// = is a assignment operator
// 17 is literal or constant or assigning value to varible
// and the whole process is known as declaring variable


// let a = 17;
// console.log(a);
// a = "Harry Potter"; // we can change the variable type at run time that's why it is dynamically typed language.
// console.log(a);

// how to declare variable

// let 123a = 4; // wrong declaration
// let @#A = 4; // wrong declaration

// let $name = "ahad"; // right declaration
// let name_lastname = "khan"; // right declaration
// let name123 = "ahad"; // right declaration

// let Ahad = "khan" 
// both will work because js is case sensitive it will take both the variables two variables. but we don't have to do this type of thing in making a program 
// because it decreses readability of the program.
